<p><em>Note: if you are a school looking for someone to talk to students about tech, this page isn't for you.  I love helping young people, and do that for free whenever I can.  Just drop me a line at my <a href="mailto:hedgemage@binaryredneck.net">personal email address</a> and I'll do my best to work with you.</em></p>
<h2>Areas Of Interest</h2>
<hr>
<p>I'm more likely to take consulting work that dovetails well with my existing priorities, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>The security of critical infrastructure, whether this be ICS/SCADA systems or software controlling physical infrastructure, or the networks and software that make the internet possible.</li>
<li>Securing life-critical systems and software.</li>
<li>Securing science and research resources.</li>
<li>Training the next generation of information security practitioners, and helping those already in our industry learn to adapt their skills to changing technologies and threats.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Hire Me</h2>
<hr>
<p>If you aren't sure where to start, email me at <a href="mailto:sons@security.engineering">sons -at- security -dot- engineering</a>, and we can go from there.  Generally, upon receipt of your introductory email, I'll either decline the project outright, or set up a call to go over the details.</p>
<p>The first things I'll want to go over are to establish my interest in the project, to figure out whether it's a good fit for my role at <a href="https://cacr.iu.edu">IU's Center for Applied Center for Cybersecurity Research</a> or something I'd need to take on through my place with <a href="http://www.jenariah.com">Jenaraiah Industrial Automation</a>, and to get some idea of scope and complexity.</p>
<p>I'm happy to talk a bit and let you get to know me, or answer specific questions, but please don't ask me to email a copy of my CV or other details you could have found on <a href="/">the page you probably got here from</a>.  My primary contact with your organization should speak fluent English so that we can communicate effectively.</p>
<h2>If You Have a Start-Up</h2>
<hr>
<p>No, I don't want to be your co-founder.  I don't care how awesome your idea is, I have things I need to finish right now that preclude me froim going all-in on building a company from scratch.</p>
<p>I may consider <em>advisor</em> roles, however.  I spent a good bit of my career moving between different tech startups, and learned a lot doing it.  One of the downsides of being joined at the hip to academia is that it's hard to remain grounded in the economy, and advising a startup or two could give me that.  Meanwhile, I've got a great deal of startup experience, a great deal of infosec experience, and a weird amount of experience from totally unrelated fields.</p>
<p>If you want me to consider advising your start-up, go ahead and <a href="mailto:sons@security.engineering">drop me an email</a>, preferably heavy on details.  If I have to watch a video to find out what your startup does, you don't respect my time.</p>
