This is a holding place for domains I'm not yet using, and a catalog of work and information I frequently reference.

## You were probably looking for:

* [Talks and Presentations I've given](/talks)
* [My CV](/files/Susan_Sons_CV.pdf), or a shorter [resume](/files/Susan_Sons_resume.pdf)
* [My personal blog](https://binaryredneck.net)
* [My workplace](https://cacr.iu.edu) *who don't censor, endorse, or seem to particularly pay attention to my speech outside of work*
* [Linux Journal](https://linuxjournal.com), where my column *Under the Sink* covers a story or idea in infrastructure software and security about every other month.

## ...or one of my projects:

* The **[Internet Civil Engineering Institute (ICEI)](https://icei.org)**, an organization dedicated to the maintenance and improvement of the infrastructure software that the internet, UNIX, and Linux depend on.
* **New Guard**, an informal mentoring group for early- and mid-career technologists interested in infrastructure software.  New Guard can be found in `#newguard` on `irc.freenode.net`.
* The **[Information Security Practice Principles (ISPPs)](https://cacr.iu.edu/principles)**, a system for working from first principles to make information security better, rather than being a slave to checklists or being out in the cold when the situation is too new for any best practice to exist.
* **[Project Dogpound](http://projectdogpound.org)** is a blog about being a protector personality.
