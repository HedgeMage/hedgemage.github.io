You've found me, sort of.  This is a parking lot for domains I own that don't have an associated web site (yet!).

## You were probably looking for:

* [My CV](/files/Susan_Sons_CV.pdf)
* [My personal blog](http://binaryredneck.net)
* [My workplace](http://cacr.iu.edu) *who don't censor, endorse, or seem to particularly pay attention to my speech outside of work*

## ...or one of my projects:

* [Project Dogpound](http://projectdogpound.org) is a blog about being a protector personality.
* [ICEI](http://icei.org) is the Internet Civil Engineering Institute, an organization dedicated to the maintenance and improvement of the infrastructure software that the internet, UNIX, and Linux depend on.
* New Guard, an informal mentoring group for early- and mid-career technologists interested in infrastructure software.  New Guard can be found in #newguard on irc.freenode.net.
  
## If not, you could always reach out via:

* [Email](mailto:hedgemage@binaryredneck.net)
* [Google Plus](http://gplus.to/hedgemage)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@hedgemage)

## Still confused?

Find out a little more about me:

By day, I work as a Senior Systems Analyst at [Indiana University's Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research](http://cacr.iu.edu).  This means that I spend about half my time [helping NSF-funded science and infrastructure projects improve their security](http://trustedci.org), the other half helping to secure a DHS-funded static analysis project (it's called [the SWAMP](https://www.mir-swamp.org), and it's free for anyone to use to make their code more stable and secure!).  I sneak in a little of my own research and various attempts to save the world from poor information security practices whenever I can.

I also volunteer as Director of the [Internet Civil Engineering Institute](http://icei.org), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting and securing the common software infrastructure we all depend on.  If you'd like to work on infrastructure software with me and people like me, please check out New Guard in my project list above.

I'm raising an amazing young mini-hacker, and in my free time, I write, code, research, practice martial arts, lift heavy things, teach backpacking for families trying to include special needs members in their adventures, and volunteer as a search-and-rescue and disaster relief worker.  Needless to say, I love the outdoors and may disappear into forests without provocation.
