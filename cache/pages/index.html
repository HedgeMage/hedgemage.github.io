<h3>Teachers</h3>
<p>If you're within my easy travel radius (generally a day trip driving from Bloomington, IN), I'd be happy to schedule a time to come talk to your classes, for free, about infosec, STEM careers, internet safety and privacy, or related subjects.  Just <a href="mailto:hedgemage@binaryredneck.net">email me</a> and we'll work out the details.</p>
<h3>Press</h3>
<p>The easiest way to reach me to discuss an interview or get background information is by <a href="mailto:hedgemage@binaryredneck.net">email</a>.  My GPG key fingerprint is <code>98FB 198F 6DE0 A2EF 45DA B29F DAF5 8F55 CAD5 AE3A</code> and a signed copy of that key is on the major keyservers.  I also have Signal and some other means of encrypted comms if needed, just contact me to set up.</p>
<h3>So, you want me on your project...</h3>
<p>I'm not looking to change jobs right now.  However, I do have some ability to work interesting projects and collaborations into my life.  <a href="/consulting">Please read this page</a> to understand what I'm interested in (and not interested in), as well as how to approach me successfully.</p>

<h2>Quick bio...probably not that interesting...</h2>
<p>By day, I work as a Senior Systems Analyst at <a href="http://cacr.iu.edu">Indiana University's Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research</a>.  This means that I split my time among a number of projects revolving around securing scientific and infrastructure technologies.  Some of these are stepping up security operations at <a href="https://www.opensciencegrid.org/">Open Science Grid</a>, <a href="http://trustedci.org">helping NSF-funded science and infrastructure projects improve their security</a>, and helping to secure a DHS-funded static analysis project called <a href="https://www.mir-swamp.org">the SWAMP</a>.  I sneak in a little of my own research and various attempts to save the world from poor information security practices whenever I can.</p>
<p>I also serve as Hacker-in-Chief of the <a href="http://icei.org">Internet Civil Engineering Institute</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting and securing the common software infrastructure we all depend on.  Please <a href="https://icei.org/donate">donate</a> if you can...a stable, free, and open internet may depend on it.</p>
<p>I'm raising an amazing young mini-hacker, and in my free time, I write, code, research, practice martial arts, lift heavy things, teach backpacking for families trying to include special needs members in their adventures, and volunteer as a search-and-rescue and disaster relief worker.  Needless to say, I love the outdoors and may disappear into forests without provocation.</p>
