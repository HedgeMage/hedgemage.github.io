<p>I grew up in a small town where we didn't have access to much, so I try to bring the cool things I do to schools whenever I can.</p>
<p>If you're within my easy travel radius (generally a day trip driving from Bloomington, IN), I'd be happy to schedule a time to come talk to your classes, for free, about infosec, STEM careers, internet safety and privacy, or related subjects.  Just <a href="sons@security.engineering">email me</a> and we'll work out the details.</p>
<p>Other fun things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LN2 (liquid nitrogen) demo with shattering flowers, shrinking and expanding balloons, and of course ice cream!  (non-dairy and non-sugar frozen goodness, too, if needed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet safety for parents, students, and staff.</p>
