### Some descriptive text (long)

By day, I work as the Chief Security Analyst at [Indiana University's Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research](https://cacr.iu.edu).  This means that I split my time among a number of projects revolving around securing scientific and infrastructure technologies.  Some of these are leading security operations at [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), teaching technologists and managers how to think about and do [information security from first principles](https://cacr.iu.edu/principles), [helping NSF-funded science and infrastructure projects improve their security](http://trustedci.org), and  helping to secure a DHS-funded static analysis project called [the SWAMP](https://www.mir-swamp.org).  I sneak in a little of my own research and various attempts to save the world from poor information security practices whenever I can.

I also serve as Hacker-in-Chief of the [Internet Civil Engineering Institute](http://icei.org), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting and securing the common software infrastructure we all depend on.  Please [donate](https://icei.org/donate) if you can...a stable, free, and open internet may depend on it.

I'm raising an amazing young mini-hacker, and in my free time, I write, code, research, practice martial arts, lift heavy things, teach backpacking for families trying to include special needs members in their adventures, and volunteer as a search-and-rescue and disaster relief worker.  Needless to say, I love the outdoors and may disappear into forests without provocation.
