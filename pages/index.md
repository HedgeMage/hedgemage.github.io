You've found me, sort of.  This is a parking lot for domains I own that don't have an associated web site (yet!).

## You were probably looking for:

* [My CV](/files/Susan_Sons_CV.pdf)
* [My personal blog](https://binaryredneck.net)
* [My workplace](https://cacr.iu.edu) *who don't censor, endorse, or seem to particularly pay attention to my speech outside of work*
* [Linux Journal](https://linuxjournal.com), where my column *Under the Sink* covers a story or idea in infrastructure software and security about every other month.

## ...or one of my projects:

* [ICEI](http://icei.org) is the Internet Civil Engineering Institute, an organization dedicated to the maintenance and improvement of the infrastructure software that the internet, UNIX, and Linux depend on.
* New Guard, an informal mentoring group for early- and mid-career technologists interested in infrastructure software.  New Guard can be found in #newguard on irc.freenode.net.
* [Project Dogpound](http://projectdogpound.org) is a blog about being a protector personality.

## Maybe you saw me in the news:

**Talking about NTPSec and saving the internet**

* [Too Big to Fail Open-Source Software Needs Hacker Help](http://observer.com/2016/11/open-source-too-big-to-fail/) Brady Dale, NY Observer
* [The internet's core infrastructure is dangerously unsupported and could crumble (but we can save it!)](http://boingboing.net/2016/11/11/the-internets-core-infrastru.html)  Cory Doctorow, BoingBoing
* [NTP: the rebirth of ailing, failing core network infrastructure](http://boingboing.net/2016/11/29/ntp-the-rebirth-of-ailing-fa.html) Cory Doctorow, BoingBoing

## Want help with something?

### Teachers
If you're within my easy travel radius (generally a day trip driving from Bloomington, IN), I'd be happy to schedule a time to come talk to your classes, for free, about infosec, STEM careers, internet safety and privacy, or related subjects.  Just [email me](mailto:hedgemage@binaryredneck.net) and we'll work out the details.

### Press
The easiest way to reach me to discuss an interview or get background information is by [email](mailto:hedgemage@binaryredneck.net).  My GPG key fingerprint is `98FB 198F 6DE0 A2EF 45DA B29F DAF5 8F55 CAD5 AE3A` and a signed copy of that key is on the major keyservers.  I also have Signal and some other means of encrypted comms if needed, just contact me to set up.

### So, you want me on your project...
I'm not looking to change jobs right now.  However, I do have some ability to work interesting projects and collaborations into my life.  [Please read this page](/consulting) to understand what I'm interested in (and not interested in), as well as how to approach me successfully.

## Quick bio...probably not that interesting...

By day, I work as a Senior Systems Analyst at [Indiana University's Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research](http://cacr.iu.edu).  This means that I split my time among a number of projects revolving around securing scientific and infrastructure technologies.  Some of these are stepping up security operations at [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), [helping NSF-funded science and infrastructure projects improve their security](http://trustedci.org), and helping to secure a DHS-funded static analysis project called [the SWAMP](https://www.mir-swamp.org).  I sneak in a little of my own research and various attempts to save the world from poor information security practices whenever I can.

I also serve as Hacker-in-Chief of the [Internet Civil Engineering Institute](http://icei.org), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting and securing the common software infrastructure we all depend on.  Please [donate](https://icei.org/donate) if you can...a stable, free, and open internet may depend on it.

I'm raising an amazing young mini-hacker, and in my free time, I write, code, research, practice martial arts, lift heavy things, teach backpacking for families trying to include special needs members in their adventures, and volunteer as a search-and-rescue and disaster relief worker.  Needless to say, I love the outdoors and may disappear into forests without provocation.
