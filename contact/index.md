<p class="lead">The simplest default is always to reach me via email at <a href="mailto:sons@security.engineering">sons@security.engineering</a>.  If unsure, start there.</p>

### My social media use is infrequent and sporadic, but you can occasionally find me on:

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susansons)
* [Ostatus / Fediverse](https://maly.io/hedgemage)
* [Diaspora](https://joindiaspora.com/people/4d067cff2c174344110107df)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@hedgemage)


### Press

I'm happy to work with the press to help explain complex technology, information security, and privacy issues in a way that's accessible.  It doesn't matter if you're looking for background, or covering something related to my projects.

The easiest way to reach me to discuss an interview or get background information is by [email](mailto:sons@security.engineering).  I have Signal, GPG, and other encrypted comms available if needed.
